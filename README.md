- The most significant of these features is the fact that Lisp descriptions of processes, called procedures, can themselves be represented and manipulated as Lisp data.

- read-eval-print loop
- the contrast between function and procedure is the distinction betweeb declarative knowledge and imperative knowledge. In mathematics we usually concerned with declarative(what is)descriptions, whereas in computer science we are usually concerned with imperative(how to ) descriptions.

- Expret programmers know how to choose the level of abstraction appropriate to their task. But is is important to be able to think in terms of these abstractions, so that we can be ready to apply them in new contexts.

- procefual representation of data - message passing
- box-and-pointer notation
- The key to organizing programs so as to more clearly reflect the signal-flow structure is to concentrate on the "signals" that flow from one stage in the process to the next
- Modular construction is a powerful strategy for controlling complexity in engineering design.
- The key idea was to erect an abstraction barrier that isolates the way rational numbers are used from their underlying representation in terms of list structure
- type tags and data-directed style
- The key idea is to link the code that specifies the data operations to the several representations by means of generic interface procedures.
